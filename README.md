# Project Description
This project uses the STM32 to construct timer and game logic to create an interactive Pacman replica with input via a joystick and keypad, with display shown on an LED matrix. High scores are stored in an on-board EEPROM chip to be loaded at the beginning of every game instance. Pacman's pellet-eating audio is converted from an MP3 file to a byte array that can be output via a speaker through a DAC.
